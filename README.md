# Learning Tkinter

Just me learning Tkinter, [ttkbootstrap](https://github.com/israel-dryer/ttkbootstrap) and using this repo to save my code.

## What I have been using to learn:

- I have been watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mop6g-c5HEY) by CLear Code to learn the basics of tk.
