# Learning Tkinter

Just me learning Tkinter, [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/tomschimansky/customtkinter), [ttkbootstrap](https://github.com/israel-dryer/ttkbootstrap) and using this repo to save my code.

Versions of Python and the libs at the moment of me codding all of that: 
```py
Python 3.12.1
ttkboutstrap==1.10.1
customtkinter==5.2.1
```

## What I have been using to learn:

- I have been mainly watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mop6g-c5HEY) and using this [this repo](https://github.com/clear-code-projects/tkinter-complete) by CLear Code to learn the basics of tk.
- The [CustomTkinter docs](https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/).
- The [ttkbootstarp docs](https://ttkbootstrap.readthedocs.io/).
- I use the [Azure theme](https://github.com/rdbende/Azure-ttk-theme) while learning themes.
