# Learning Tkinter

Just me learning Tkinter, [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/tomschimansky/customtkinter), [ttkbootstrap](https://github.com/israel-dryer/ttkbootstrap) and using this repo to save my code.

Versions of Python and the libs at the moment of me codding all of that: 
```py
Python 3.12.1
ttkboutstrap==1.10.1
customtkinter==5.2.1
```
